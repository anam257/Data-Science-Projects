    "- purchase a whole album\n",
    "- purchase a collection of one or more individual tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The store does not let customers purchase a whole album, and then add individual tracks to that same purchase (unless they do that by choosing each track manually). When customers purchase albums they are charged the same price as if they had purchased each of those tracks separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management are currently considering changing their purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question:** So, we find out what percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums, so that management can use this data to understand the effect this decision might have on overall revenue.\n",

    "- For performing an analysis we have 'edge cases' which prevent us from getting a 100% accurate answer to our question. In this instance, we have two edge cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Albums that have only one or two tracks are likely to be purchased by customers as part of a collection of individual tracks.\n",
    "    - Customers may decide to manually select every track from an album, and then add a few individual tracks from other albums to their purchase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since our analysis is concerned with maximizing revenue we can safely ignore edge cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: We start by analyzing by identifying whether each invoice has all the tracks from an album.**\n",
    "- Comparing list of tracks from invoice with list of tracks from an album\n",
    "    - Find the album to compare the purchase to by looking up the album that one of the purchased tracks belongs to. It doesn't matter which track we pick, since if it's an album purchase, that album will be the same for all tracks.\n",
